- special registers
- extensively used for indirect addressing as a register pair **HL**
	- *Indirect addressing* is when instead of specifying a specific address for an operation, you can use the 16-bit value in HL
- good for calculations on addresses
- only register pair that can be used indirectly in the instructions:
	- ADC
	- ADD
	- AND
	- CP
	- DEC
	- INC
	- OR
	- SUB
	- XOR
