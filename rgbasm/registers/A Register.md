- where almost all data passes through
- the "accumulator"
- only 8-bit register that can be shifted by a 1 byte instruction
	- what does this mean??
	- only register that can be complemented, decimal adjusted, or negated with a single byte instruction
- it's the source **and** destination of all 8-bit arithemtic and logical instructions
	- except **INC** and **DEC**
	- i.e. if you want to add two numbers together, you'd add some number in register A with a number in some other register, then the result is stored in register A
