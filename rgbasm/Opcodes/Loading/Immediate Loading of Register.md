 **LD C, 3**  
This instruction loads register **C** with the value 3. The 3 is an 8-bit data item, NOT a 16-bit address. Also, do not confuse the plain decimal 3 with $0003, even though they are relatively equal.  
  
**LD DE, $FF80**
This instruction loads register pair **DE** with the value $FF80. This would be the same as loading register **D** with $FF and loading register **E** with $80.
